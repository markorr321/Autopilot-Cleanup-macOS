## 📋 Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.0 or later
- Required module (auto-installed if missing):
  - `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`

## 🔐 Required Permissions

Your account needs the following Microsoft Graph API permissions:

- `Device.ReadWrite.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All`
- `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All`

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open PowerShell
3. Navigate to the script directory
4. Run the script - it will automatically check and install required modules

```powershell
cd C:\Autopilot-Cleanup
.\Autopilot-CleanUp.ps1
```

Or import the module and use the `Start-AutopilotCleanup` command:

```powershell
Import-Module .\AutopilotCleanup
Start-AutopilotCleanup
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🎯 Basic Usage

```powershell
.\Autopilot-CleanUp.ps1
```

1. Script will check for required modules and prompt to install if missing
2. Connects to Microsoft Graph (you'll be prompted to sign in)
3. Retrieves all Autopilot devices and enriches with Intune/Entra ID data
4. Displays interactive grid view with all devices
5. **Select device(s) using Ctrl+Click for multiple selection, then press OK**
6. Confirms deletion from all three services
7. Monitors removal progress in real-time

### 🔑 Custom App Registration

Configure a custom app registration for delegated auth (persists across sessions):

```powershell
Import-Module .\AutopilotCleanup
Configure-AutopilotCleanup
```

Or pass credentials directly:

```powershell
.\Autopilot-CleanUp.ps1 -ClientId "your-client-id" -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
```

To clear saved configuration:

```powershell
Clear-AutopilotCleanupConfig
```

**Priority order:** command-line parameters > environment variables > default auth flow

**Required app registration settings:**
- Platform: Mobile and desktop applications
- Redirect URI: `http://localhost`
- Allow public client flows: Yes
- API Permissions (delegated): `Device.ReadWrite.All`, `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All`, `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.PrivilegedOperations.All`, `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All`

### 🧪 WhatIf Mode (Test Run)

Preview what would be deleted without making actual changes:

```powershell
.\Autopilot-CleanUp.ps1 -WhatIf
```

## 📝 Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `-WhatIf` | Switch | No | Preview mode - shows what would be deleted without performing actual deletions |
| `-ClientId` | String | No | Client ID of a custom app registration for delegated auth |
| `-TenantId` | String | No | Tenant ID to use with the custom app registration |
| `-SerialNumber` | String[] | No | One or more serial numbers to target directly, bypasses the WPF grid |

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Module Validation** - Verifies required PowerShell modules are installed
2. **Authentication** - Connects to Microsoft Graph with required scopes
3. **Data Retrieval** - Fetches all Autopilot devices and enriches with Intune/Entra ID information
4. **Device Selection** - Displays interactive Out-GridView where you select devices to remove
   - **⚠️ Important**: Use Ctrl+Click to select multiple devices, then click OK to confirm
   - Selection works like Windows Explorer (highlight-based, not checkboxes)
5. **Deletion Process** - Removes selected devices in the following order:
   - Microsoft Intune (management layer)
   - Windows Autopilot (deployment service)
   - Microsoft Entra ID (identity source)
6. **Verification** - Monitors and confirms successful removal from all services

## 📋 Device Selection Grid

The Out-GridView displays the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DisplayName | Device display name |
| SerialNumber | Hardware serial number |
| Model | Device model |
| Manufacturer | Device manufacturer |
| GroupTag | Autopilot group tag |
| DeploymentProfile | Assigned deployment profile |
| IntuneFound | Whether device exists in Intune |
| EntraFound | Whether device exists in Entra ID |
| IntuneName | Device name in Intune |
| EntraName | Device name in Entra ID |

**✅ To select devices**:
- **Single device**: Click on the device row, then click **OK**
- **Multiple devices**: Hold **Ctrl** and click on each device you want to select
- **Range of devices**: Click the first device, hold **Shift**, and click the last device
- **All devices**: Press **Ctrl+A** to select all
- Click **OK** when finished selecting

*Note: Out-GridView uses highlight selection (like Windows Explorer) rather than checkboxes. Use Ctrl+Click to build your multi-selection.*

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🚨 **Deletion is permanent** - Devices removed from these services cannot be easily restored
- 🔢 **Serial number validation** - The script validates serial numbers to prevent accidental deletion of duplicate device names
- ⚡ **Deletion order matters** - Devices are removed in the correct order (Intune → Autopilot → Entra ID) to prevent dependency issues
- ⏱️ **Monitoring timeout** - The script monitors deletion progress for up to 30 minutes
- 👤 **No admin required** - Module installation uses CurrentUser scope, avoiding the need for administrator privileges
- 🔔 **Success notification** - Three ascending beeps play when device cleanup is successfully verified across all services

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Modules Won't Install
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Run PowerShell with appropriate permissions
- Manually install modules: `Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser`

### 🔒 Authentication Fails
- Verify your account has the required Graph API permissions
- Check if MFA is properly configured
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting: `Disconnect-MgGraph` then run the script again

### 🔍 Device Not Found
- Device may already be deleted
- Serial number or device name may be incorrect
- Check if device exists in each service individually

### ⏳ Deletion Hangs
- Large deletions can take time (up to 30 minutes)
- Check Azure portal to verify deletion status
- Script will timeout after 30 minutes of monitoring

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AUTOPILOTCLEANUP_CLIENTID` | Saved app registration Client ID (set via `Configure-AutopilotCleanup`) |
| `AUTOPILOTCLEANUP_TENANTID` | Saved Tenant ID (set via `Configure-AutopilotCleanup`) |
| `AUTOPILOTCLEANUP_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK` | Set to `true` to skip the update check on launch |
